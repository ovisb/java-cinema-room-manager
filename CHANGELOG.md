  Completed project

TODO: Once I get more familiar with OOP in Java I will refactor this project to make proper use of classes and objects as the current solution is mostly procedural, even if it's wrapped up in a class :).

29.12.2023
- Refactored and simplified methods
- Split functionality into different classes.

30.12.2023
- moved fetching input from user from the cinema class to the userinterface
- moved input validation into separate class
